ISTE organizes various workshops such as Intro to GIT, Python: basic to advance, OpenCV and much more. Apart from workshops ISTE has its own Tech Week.This is club’s flagship event of even semester. The TechWeek brings in all the different domains of engineering into a series of events. TechWeek has many events like “Watt Up”, “ExQUIZite”, “Clueless”, “Unlockathon” and “Clash of Codes”. The TechWeek had a participation of over 1200 people including both Online and Offline event. ISTE also has a lot to offer even if you're not in the campus.In summer and winter breaks ISTE organizes summer and winter school which is a crash course of latest technologies taught by none other than your own seniors.If all that was not enough then guess what ISTE is the only club to organize on-demand workshops.</p>
